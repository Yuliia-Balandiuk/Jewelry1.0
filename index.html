                <h3>Diamond Сolor</h3>
                <p>The color of a diamond is one of the most important characteristics since it is color that is perceived by human eyes. Some components of visible 
                light are absorbed inside the diamond, which is caused either by the presence of trace elements or by a feature of the structure of the diamond. 
                Unabsorbed particles of light form the visible color of the diamond.</p>

                <h3>Diamond Purity</h3>
                <p>Diamond purity defines the transparency, absence or degree of internal or external diamond defects. The purity of a diamond shows how easily light 
                can penetrate a diamond, bounce off its edges, refract, and scatter onto multi-colored rays. The attractiveness and durability, and therefore value, 
                depends on the purity of a diamond.</p>

                <h3>Types of Faceting</h3>
                <p>Nowadays, three main types of cut are used: diamond cut, old step cut and mixed, which is a combination of the first two types of faceting. 
                Various combinations of faceted diamond shapes and cuts form a dozen popular diamond cut shapes. The diamond cutting was created for the optimal 
                combination of brilliance and the “play" of light.</p>
